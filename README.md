# HR-Analysis-Dashboard
## üìù Problem Statement:  

Organizations face challenges in understanding workforce demographics, compensation, leave balances, and employee distribution across roles. HR teams need insights to make data-driven decisions for workforce planning, diversity initiatives, and productivity improvements.

## üöÄ Approach:

**1**. Collected and cleaned HR data (employee demographics, salaries, job roles, and leave balance).

**2**. Processed and analyzed the data using Excel & SQL for initial exploration.

**3**. Built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize workforce patterns and track KPIs.

**4**. Designed charts to highlight employee headcount trends, salary distribution, gender ratio, qualifications, and age distribution.

### üìä Data Visualization in Power BI:

**Headcount by Job Role** ‚Äì Identifies workforce distribution across job titles.

**Headcount by Gender** ‚Äì Visualizes gender diversity.

**Age Distribution** ‚Äì Shows age bands of staff to understand generational diversity.

**Salary vs Qualification** ‚Äì Compares staff qualifications with salary brackets.

**Headcount Trend Over Time** ‚Äì Tracks employee growth from 2017 onwards.

### üìå Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

**Total Headcount**: 161 employees

**Average Salary**: $54K

**Average Leave Balance**: 16.42 days

**Employees with Leave Balance > 20 days**: 29

## ‚úÖ Conclusion / Insights:

* Workforce is slightly female-dominated (54.66% vs 45.34%).

* Majority of employees fall within the 30‚Äì40 age group, showing a mid-career workforce.

* Packaging Associates & Production Operators make up the largest share of roles.

* Master‚Äôs Degree holders generally earn higher salaries, but there are outliers across other qualifications.

* Headcount has shown steady growth since 2017, with sharp increases post-2020.

* HR may need to address employees holding high leave balances to avoid productivity dips.
